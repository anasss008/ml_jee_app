# This project aims to create :

- Eye disease detection : Custom made Machine learning model to analyze retinal images and identify various eye diseases, including : cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and more. Early detection can significantly improve the chances of successful treatment.
- Personalized Patient Notifications: When a potential eye disease is detected in a patient's retinal scan, the system sends automated notifications to the patient, urging them to connect to our platform in order to be connected with doctors.
- Doctor Recommendation System: Connecting patients with specialized eye care professionals. The system recommends ophthalmologists and optometrists (who are verified by our team) in the patient's area, ensuring that they receive the best possible care tailored to their specific condition.
